### Hello World
I'm Jo√£o Gabriel Tavares, _aka_ Jojo.

I have a lot of ideas (maybe too much) and I need to put them in practice somehow - for the sake of my sanity! Those ideas are not necessarilly in the technology expectrum, I have ideas for songs, games, story scripts, cooking and - of course - tech projects!

Here I'll try to summarize part of what I've been doing latelly!

### What I've been up to
- üíº I'm currently working at [@olxbr](https://github.com/olxbr) as a Software Engineer.
- üå©Ô∏è **[Hackz App](https://hackzapp.com)** - This is currently my main private project - still a work in progress - where you can integrate your Slack status with your Google Calendar. Kinda' like Clockwise but better - I hope so at least. I intend to make this an open source project in the future.
- üíª **My Ideal PC** - It's a browser extension that helps you find the ideal PC setup for your use case. I paused this project in order to dedicate more time to other things but I intend to get back to it soon.
- üéµ **[SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/jojotavares)** - I'm also a musician and I really enjoy songwriting and producing new songs. Check my SoundCloud profile to enjoy - or not - my work.
- üé• **[Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/jogabiel/)** - I really enjoy cinema, I'm not an expert critic but now and then I like to give my opinion on some productions. Check my Letterboxd profile to see some of my favorite movies and what I've been watching.
