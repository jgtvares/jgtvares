### Hello World
I'm João Gabriel Tavares, _aka_ Jojo.

I have a lot of ideas (maybe too many) and I need to put them into practice somehow - for the sake of my sanity! Those ideas are not necessarily in the technology spectrum, I have ideas for songs, games, story scripts, cooking, and - of course - tech projects!

Here I'll try to summarize part of what I've been doing latelly!

### What I've been up to
- 💼 I'm currently working at [@olxbr](https://github.com/olxbr) as a Software Engineer.
- 🌩️ **[Hackz App](https://hackzapp.com)** - This is currently my biggest private project - still a work in progress - where you can integrate your Slack status with your Google Calendar. Kinda' like Clockwise but better - I hope so at least. I intend to make this an open source project in the future.
- 💻 **My Ideal PC** - It's a browser extension that helps you find the ideal PC setup for your use case. I paused this project in order to dedicate more time to other things but I intend to get back to it someday.
- 🚗 **[Compra Carro Sim](https://www.compracarrosim.com.br)** - A very simple web app that helps people to make a car financing simulation. This project was designed for national - Brazil - use only.
- 🎵 **[SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/jojotavares)** - I'm also a musician and I really enjoy songwriting and producing new songs. Check my SoundCloud profile to enjoy - or not - my work.
- 🎥 **[Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/jogabiel/)** - I love cinema, I'm not an expert critic but now and then I like to give my opinion on some productions. Check my Letterboxd profile to see some of my favorite movies and what I've been watching.
